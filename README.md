# PyChain_Ledger

This blockchain-based ledger allows different entities to conduct financial transactions to transfer a virtual asset like money between senders and receivers, and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.
It is runned using the Streamlit web interface.
The PyChain ledger creates blocks with the "Add Block" button  that contains the information of the sender, receiver and the amount to transfer, and record it in a ledger. Also it is stored in the ledger: the creator id, the previous hash, the timestamp and the nonce of the record.
It also has a validation button to verify the blockchain.
